# vCenter-Server-7.0-File-Transfer-with-SCP-SFTP

To be able to connect with WinSCP, the default shell has to be configured to /bin/bash:
# chsh -s "/bin/bash" root
If you want to revert this change later and reactivate the Appliance Shell, change the default shell back to /bin/appliancesh:
# chsh -s /bin/appliancesh root
